        <h1>Let's show you how to make them!</h1>
        <h3>Here are the ingredients you will need</h3>
        <h2>For the chicken:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Juice of two limes.</li>
            <li>One tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the toppings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup finely chopped red or sweet onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup finely chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1 finely chopped jalapeno</li>
            <li>Juice of one lime</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper, for taste</li>
            <li>1 lime, cut into 8 pieces.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large zipper-topped plastic baggie or in shallow dish, add the chicken, all of the spices, lime juice, and oil. Close the bag and use your hands to mix everything together.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add a tablespoon of oil to the pan and then add the chicken. Cook for 12 to 14 minutes, turning once, until the chicken is cooked through. </li>
            <li>While the chicken cooks, stir together the chicken taco topping by placing the chopped onion, cilantro, jalapeño, and the juice of one lime in a small bowl. Add salt and pepper, and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Place two tortillas (still stacked together) on the skillet and cook until the underside starts to char. Flip over and cook the other side.</li>
            <li>Chop the rested chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>To serve, place ⅛ of the chopped chicken in each set of tortillas (still two stacked together) and top with ⅛ of your onion mixture. Serve each taco with a wedge of lime to squeeze over the taco just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
